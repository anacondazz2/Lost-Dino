# Lost Dino
A roguelike-esque rpg game made on Greenfoot (Java framework)!

When your friend wanders too deep into an abandoned castle, it is now your job to rescue them!
There are 4 levels and one final boss level. You get stronger as you progress through the game, gaining a new weapon and ability.

## How to Run
1. Download [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download).

2. Download the .gfar file and try to open it.
This may also download a "lost-dino" folder that contains all the files for the game. If opening the .gfar file fails, delete the .gfar file and open "project.greenfoot" inside this folder. 

Enjoy playing!
